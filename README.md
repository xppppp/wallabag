# what is wallabag ?

## About development
We are working on a technical rework, using Symfony 2. You can contribute to [this version here](https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/tree/v2).

wallabag 1.x is still maintained but we won't develop new features. 

## Description
wallabag is a self hostable application allowing you to not miss any content anymore. Click, save, read it when you can. It extracts content so that you can read it when you have time.
